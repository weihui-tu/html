			<h2>
				Definition of ethics
			</h2>
			<p>
				Ethics comes from the word "ethos" and represents an argumentative reflection for the good to do. Computer ethics, on the other hand, represents the way people and computer scientists use the data collected, and then make decisions based on the ethical aspect.<br>However, there is no single ethic, each people have an ethic that seems to it to be in harmony with its culture and realities. And also, within the same people there may be differences on points such as technical advances which for some represent the cause of a possible end of the world.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Examples of ethical dilemmas: autonomous vehicles
			</h2>
			<p>
				Autonomous vehicles are expected to reduce the number of traffic accidents. But how will a vehicle behave if it has to make a choice between crushing a pedestrian or endangering the passengers in the vehicle so as not to injure the pedestrian? The work of developers as a result is difficult to conceive, if they are to ensure that machines must be able to make ethical choices.

				The ethical issues of AI in France
			</h2>
			<img src="images\CNIL.jpg">
			<p>
				At the moment the position of France and Europe is not fixed and a  CNIL report on this subject can provide us with more information on the ethical issues related to AI.
			</p>
			<p> In a world that is digitizing every day, artificial intelligence is beginning to become the key to the future: for all our daily tasks. Even in new situations such as suggesting priority patrol areas to police officers, implementing a personalized medical diagnosis, or developing updated social networks, etc. Increasingly, work is being delegated to the machine. And this complex, critical work allows artificial intelligence to learn, and to collect more and more data necessary for its effectiveness. 
			</p>
			<p>With the mission of reflecting on ethical issues following the arrival of digital technology in our lives, the CNIL has decided to question itself on algorithms in the age of artificial intelligence, the results of which have revealed two pillars for artificial intelligence for humans. 
			</p>
			<h2>
				The ethical issues of AI in China
			</h2>
			<img src="images\graphique.jpg">
			<p>
				Nowadays, artificial intelligence is widely used in China. According to the white paper of China's artificial intelligence industry released by Deloitte, China's artificial intelligence industry is developing very rapidly. In 2018, China's AI market has a scale of more than 30 billion yuan, or 380 million euros. The company of AI has reached 1,000, ranking second in the world.</p>
			<p>As shown in the above figure, China's market size in the field of artificial intelligence has increased from 14.46 billion euros in 2015 to 28.01 billion euros in 2017, a year-on-year growth of 52.8%. It is predicted that China's artificial intelligence market will reach 91.64 in 2020, the compound annual growth rate will reach 44.5%.</p>
			<p>However, is the facial recognition system really good and harmless?
			<p>First of all, we should be concerned about whether the information can be safely saved or not. In China, biological information such as human faces and fingerprints are collected and stored with each individual's personal information. If information is stored insecurely, information theft occurs, which will have unpredictable consequences.</p>
			<p>Secondly, does the Chinese government and some other Chinese institutions, for the compulsory of face recognition, infringe on the privacy of residents? Recently, whether face recognition can guarantee the security of personal data and whether students have privacy are some hot topics on the Chinese network. The smart campus solution provided by the Kuangshi technology company can help the school improve the management of school, it can be used to ensure the safety of students, or to consider the student's attendance, and also monitor the student's class status, such as whether the students sleep, play mobile phones, etc. This phenomenon is undoubtedly a violation of the privacy of students.

                <h1>AI and Social : progress and regression</h1>              
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="large_section_container_text">
			<h2>
				Social progress caused by AI 
			</h2>
			<h3>
				Government
			</h3>
			<p>Driven by artificial intelligence technology, government services will move toward a more humane and targeted direction. On the one hand, the public services for residents and enterprises will be more in line with human habits. On the other hand, the decision-making of artificial intelligence will be more effective, the precision will be greatly improved, and the disposal plan will be more flexible.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Transport
			</h3>
			<p>
				Since 2000, GPS and sensors have provided data and application support and preparation for the emergence of driverless. At present, the application of artificial intelligence in the unmanned field is unmanned. In the field of logistics, unmanned driving can be applied to long-distance truck transportation and distribution on closed roads. 
			</p>
			<h3>
				Retail
			</h3>
			<p>
				Enterprise can use machine learning technology to generate user portraits, advertise their preferences, and analyze their real needs. In the interaction with customers, the merchant generates a large amount of data, and through a large amount of data accumulation and machine learning, can deeply analyze and understand consumer preferences and needs, and mark dozens or even hundreds of labels for each customer.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Manufacture
			</h3>
			<p>
				Robots replace workers in hazardous locations, and manufacturers use computer vision technology to efficiently and accurately identify defective products.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Social regression caused by AI
			</h2>
			<p>
				At the same time, artificial intelligence also has a negative impact, and many people are worried about it.
			</p>

			<h3>
				Unemployment
			</h3>
			<p>
				Robotics and automation have made great strides, especially in the manufacturing sector. According to a 2013 study by the Oxford University School of Engineering, in the next 20 years, nearly half of the jobs in the United States, 47% of people face the risk of being replaced by automation.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Security problems 
			</h3>
			<p>  ●	Security issues caused by technical or management defects<br>
				 Some technical defects lead to abnormal work, which may cause safety hazards in artificial intelligence systems. For example, the design and improper production of robots and unmanned intelligent systems may cause abnormal operation. In addition, if the safety protection technology or measures are not perfect, unmanned vehicles, robots and other artificial intelligence devices may be illegally invaded and controlled.</p>
			<p>	 ●	Future security concerns caused by super intelligence<br>
				 The long-term artificial intelligence security risk refers to the assumption that artificial intelligence develops into a super-intelligent stage, when robots or other artificial intelligence systems can self-evolve and may develop human-like self-awareness, thus posing a threat to human survival.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Double-edged sword in AI
			</h2>
			<p>
				We will see that artificial intelligence can make it possible to make progress in three major areas for humanity.<br>
				The first one is about energy reduction. In 2010, an American company called DeepMind created an artificial intelligence system to scan and analyze energy loss. This algorithm has been used in Google's data centers and allows an energy saving of around 30%, which at the time seemed completely impossible. Applying it on a large scale, it can therefore be assumed that industries can drastically reduce their energy consumption thanks to artificial intelligence. <br>
				In the field of medicine, nearly 250 million people are affected to varying degrees by vision loss, and the same company developed software in collaboration with London's Moorfields Eye Hospital to identify and recommend treatment for several symptoms that threaten vision.<br>
				In the field of energy, the potential use of artificial intelligence will considerably reduce the time required to test new molecules that could be the basis of clean energy by reducing research time from around 10 to 20 years currently to only 2 years.</p>
			<p>	After having seen the main ethical advances related to artificial intelligence, we will now look at the different fears that exist at social levels regarding the importance of the development of artificial intelligence in our lives.In the collective imagination, we can see that many citizens think that the development of new technologies can be a problem for their quality of life, for example the loss of their jobs, which would represent a social decline.<br>
				Indeed, over the past 40 years there has been a rapid growth of information technology such as the cloud, the Internet, databases, social networks, software and many others.As a result, the number of jobs created to enable the constant introduction of these new technologies is constantly increasing.</p>
			<p>	However, with the AI, the problem is different, because before, the invention of all these technologies was seen as an aid for the different works of Man. Today, however, the collective consciousness sees more in artificial intelligence, a technology created to replace their jobs.Indeed, in the long term, artificial intelligence will replace the role of many jobs, for example, in decision-making or repetitive tasks.

                <h1>Ethics and technological issues</h1>              
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="large_section_container_text">
		<p>
				The purpose of our part is to show that technological progress is linked on the one hand to ethics, that however there are purely scientific approaches that are not interested at all or have no moral value and that ethics can therefore generate technological restrictions.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Technological progress linked to ethics
			</h2>
			<h3>
				Retro-engineering
			</h3>
			<p>
				In 2014, Amazon is launching a new artificial intelligence system to improve recruitment within the company. This artificial intelligence is based on the machine learning system i.e. it integrates a database well a set of giving the bones different profiles exist while already working for amazon. It must therefore make the link between the existing profiles and the future profiles presented to select the best candidates to work at Amazon. The problem that followed was that this machine only selects profiles that existed at Amazon, i.e. if there were 70 percent of employees who were white and who left big studies, the majority of CVs represented men of color or men who had not done big studies and/or women.The solution provided by scientists and retro engineering . Retro-engineering is a technique consisting in understanding the opaque operation of these machines. Indeed, an artificial intelligence is based on a program, an algorithm but its functioning is anchored in a black box that makes all the operations it undertakes completely opaque. 
			</p>
			<h3>
				Automation
			</h3>
			<p>
				Another example of technological progress linked to ethics through artificial intelligence and the automation of tasks. In 2015, France ruled via article L. 4161-1 of the Labor Code that excessive repetitive work can have health risks linked in particular to postures, joint angles, the force to be exercised is the speed of execution of the tasks adopted by some workers throughout the day has been recognized as a factor of penury. The ethical solution to this problem has therefore been to create artificial intelligences that make it possible to automate tasks and thus make the employee's life more pleasant and increase the company's profit.<br>
				This automation is called automation for artificial intelligence. Automation allows the operation of one or more machines to carry out a specific program, without direct human intervention, for example in the context of an industrial application where the machines will be able to professionally maintain other machines, thus no longer requiring delicate and strenuous interventions by workers, thus enabling the company to reduce the cost of labor required to maintain the machines and to increase its production. 
			</p>
			<h2>
				 Technological restrictions caused by ethics
			</h2>
			<p>By definition, scientific approaches do not take into account the discourse of moral values. The purpose of science is to produce facts. They are therefore amoral (and not immoral) and ethically neutral, which is the condition for their universality/objectivity. 
			The discourse on values is not inferior or contradictory to the discourse on facts. It just doesn't belong in the scientific discourse.
			</p>
			<h3>
				The health
			</h3>
			<p>
				In the field of health and more particularly in genetics, scientific progress is making it possible to predict and modify the human genome. Its multiple applications, particularly on the prevention of disease and the increase in human life expectancy, are called into question by moral problems caused by the use of these techniques such as "designer babies" , cloning, or transhumanism. These practices being an undeniable technological progress could appear as a blessing for humankind by granting it a better genetic heritage and therefore a better quality of life but ethically it is eugenics. 
			</p>
			<h3>
				Safety and security
			</h3>
			<p>
				In terms of security, the progress in facial recognition and behavioral prediction made in recent years, particularly with the example of the IA used by the government in China, as explained above, could lead to an increase in the security and protection of populations. Indeed, the possibility of having a 24-hour overview in public spaces while identifying the least people present could drastically reduce crime. "If we use artificial intelligence correctly, we will be able to know in advance who could be a terrorist, who could do something wrong," says Li Meng, Deputy Minister of Science and Technology.
			</p>
			<h3>
				The benefit
			</h3>
			<p>
				In the world of industry there are a multitude of algorithms seeking to offer users and In the world of industry there are a multitude of algorithms seeking to offer users and therefore potential customers a personalized experience by, for example, targeted advertising based on their data.<br>
				Such applications represent a plus for companies to gain by allowing them to sell more while ensuring customer loyalty by giving customers the impression that their desires/needs are being addressed on a case-by-case basis.

			<p>According to the historical experience, the emergence of new technologies can enhance human productivity, improve people's living standards, and let human social progress. Artificial intelligence is still in its infancy. Now as all of the countries are developing AI technology, they are also focus on the establishment of laws and regulations on AI security, ethics and privacy. Artificial intelligence can only develop if people can trust its reliability.

			<h2>
				The design of AI
			</h2>
			<p>
				After the artificial intelligence is running, it is no longer completely under the command of the manufacturer, so its operation is unpredictable. At the same time, its operation process is not open and traceable, and its scope and speed are uncontrollable, which brings potential security problems. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a framework that conforms to human moral standards and incorporate it into the design of artificial intelligence.<br>
		 
				Different countries have common and different ideas in artificial intelligence design. Some of the consensus principles:
			</p>
				<p>
				a.	The principle of human interest, the idea is that artificial intelligence is designed for the goal of human interests. Artificial intelligence should respect human rights and reach the ultimate goal of maximizing human interests. At the same time, we should avoid deviations in moral and ethical judgments and pay attention to human rights equality in order to prevent gender discrimination and racial discrimination.<br>

				b.	The principle of responsibility is that a clear system of accountability should be established at the design step so that it can be accountable to relevant personnel and departments at the technical level. And we should also follow the principle of transparency, which means we should understand how artificial intelligence systems work to predict their future development. And understand the source of information to prevent biased information from entering the AI database. <br>
				</p>
				<p>
				However, due to cultural and political differences, each country has different regulations for artificial intelligence.<br>

				In terms of the principle of responsibility:<br>
				a.	Whether artificial intelligence is interpretable. Whether the technology can be explained clearly. In different countries, there is a different interpretation of interpretability. In addition to the developer's responsibility, the user is aware of the risks and understands the rules of how it operates. In that case, they must also bear part of the responsibility.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
				b.	The controllability of artificial intelligence. Whether it can be controlled by a technician. Different countries have different ownership of AI, it depends on the different architectures of different societies.<br> 
				</p>
				<p>
				In the principle of human interests:
				Fairness: The national conditions of different countries are different. For example,      comparing with China and the US, the US is an immigrant country, which means the ethnic  composition is much more complicated than China, they need to consider more about the  fairness of races. Therefore, it is difficult to reach a consensus.
			</p>
			<h2>
				The usage of AI
			</h2>
			<p>
				Although most countries have general rules for the artificial intelligence industry (US; EU; China), it is difficult for the IAS design industry to fully follow the general rules.<br>

				The development of artificial intelligence is based on the application of information technology for large amounts of data, and inevitably involves the reasonable use of personal information, so there should be a clear and actionable definition of privacy.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are two types of control over private information: the collection of non-expressed consent by the user (general terms) and the collection of personal information under explicit consent by the user. The development of artificial intelligence technology has brought new challenges to the original mode of control over private information, because the border of personal information collected is no longer clear. Therefore, information derived from artificial intelligence will exceed the information that citizens originally agreed to disclose, and such behavior should be regulated.<br>

				In contrast to the general rules of the IA industry in China and the European Union, the requirements for transparency of the algorithm can be seen to ensure the accountability of the IAS.
